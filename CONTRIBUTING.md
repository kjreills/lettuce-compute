## How to contribute

1. **Open an issue first** for anything non-trivial (new features, behavior changes,
   architectural shifts) so we can agree on the approach before you invest time.
2. **Fork** the repo and create a topic branch off `main`.
3. Make your change. Keep PRs focused — one logical change per PR.
4. **Make sure it builds and tests pass:**
   - Go services: `go build ./...` and `go test ./...` in `services/infrastructure`
     and `services/volunteer-cli`
   - Dashboard: `npm install && npm test` in `services/dashboard`
5. Run linters where configured (`golangci-lint run`, `npm run lint`).
6. **Sign off every commit** (see [DCO](#developer-certificate-of-origin-dco)):
   `git commit -s`
7. Open a pull request. Describe the change and link the issue.

## Running integration tests

Most Go tests run with plain `go test ./...`. A subset is gated by the
`//go:build integration` tag and needs a real Postgres — without
`LETTUCE_TEST_DB_URL` they `t.Skip`. Two modules contain integration tests:
`services/infrastructure` and `services/volunteer-cli`.

### 1. Stand up an ephemeral Postgres

Use port `5433` to avoid clashing with a local Postgres on `5432`. Pick podman
or docker — the flags are identical:

```bash
podman run -d --name lettuce-test-pg \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=lettuce -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=testpass -e POSTGRES_DB=lettuce \
  -p 5433:5432 postgres:16-alpine
```

(replace `podman` with `docker` if you prefer). Wait for the container to be
ready with `pg_isready -h localhost -p 5433` before continuing.

### 2. Apply migrations

The test harness's `setupTestDB` does **not** migrate — it assumes a
pre-migrated schema. Migrations are embedded via golang-migrate, so they're
applied by code, not the CLI. The simplest way to run them against the test DB
is a throwaway program. Create `services/infrastructure/cmd/testmigrate/main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/lettuce-compute/infrastructure/internal/database"
)

func main() {
	if err := database.RunMigrations(os.Getenv("LETTUCE_TEST_DB_URL")); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

Then from `services/infrastructure`:

```bash
go run ./cmd/testmigrate
```

Delete the `cmd/testmigrate` directory when you're done — it's not meant to be
committed.

### 3. Export the env vars

All of these need to be set for a green run. The first is what most tests
read; the rest are required by `internal/database/*_test.go`, which builds its
own `DatabaseConfig` from the individual components. Without
`LETTUCE_TEST_DB_PASSWORD` and `LETTUCE_TEST_DB_NAME` you'll see auth failures
against a `lettuce_test` DB that doesn't exist.

```bash
export LETTUCE_TEST_DB_URL=postgres://lettuce:testpass@localhost:5433/lettuce?sslmode=disable
export LETTUCE_TEST_DB_HOST=localhost
export LETTUCE_TEST_DB_PORT=5433
export LETTUCE_TEST_DB_NAME=lettuce
export LETTUCE_TEST_DB_USER=lettuce
export LETTUCE_TEST_DB_PASSWORD=testpass
```

### 4. Run the tests

Integration test packages share **one** test DB and `DELETE` common tables
during setup/teardown, so running packages concurrently causes cross-package
contention (shared mutable state, not a real bug). Serialize with `-p=1`:

```bash
go test -tags=integration -p=1 ./...
```

Run that once in `services/infrastructure`, then again in
`services/volunteer-cli`.

### 5. Tear down

```bash
podman rm -f lettuce-test-pg
```

(or `docker rm -f`). Confirm with `podman ps -a` (or `docker ps -a`) — the
name should be gone.

### Windows caveat

Hardware detection on Windows no longer launches `wmic` or `amd-smi` (both
could raise UAC elevation prompts or stall); CPU and display adapters are read
from the registry. If `TestE2EV04FullLifecycle` is the only test failing on a
Windows host, suspect the environment (container backend, ports) before your
change; it passes on Linux CI.

## Load-testing with swarm-sim

`swarm-sim` is a volunteer-swarm simulator used to load-test a head and
calibrate its dispatch tuning. It lives at
`services/volunteer-cli/cmd/swarm-sim` (in the volunteer-cli module, the only
place that can import the real signing client, so each simulated volunteer
speaks the genuine per-request-signed protocol). It spins up a fleet of
simulated volunteers, optionally seeds a leaf with work units over the head's
HTTP admin API, runs for a fixed duration, and prints a metrics report.

### Profiles

- **`naive`** — loops `RequestWorkUnit` with `MaxAssignments=1` at a fixed
  interval and **ignores** the head's *server-directed retry delay*. It
  approximates a pre-batching client and produces the maximum request noise.
- **`buffered`** — the full client model: it requests work in batches
  (*work batching*), maintains an in-memory *client work buffer* sized in hours,
  **obeys** the *server-directed retry delay*, makes **zero** `RequestWorkUnit`
  calls while its buffer is full, and treats *per-client rate limiting*
  (`ResourceExhausted`) as a fixed local backoff.
- **`overload`** — the saturation driver: a hot `RequestWorkUnit` loop with
  **no** inter-request delay that ignores the *server-directed retry delay*
  entirely, so a fleet larger than the head's dispatch ceiling pins the hot
  path. Use it to measure the single-head dispatch ceiling (the report's
  per-second **peak dispatch/sec**) and to prove the head sheds gracefully
  (`ResourceExhausted`) instead of collapsing the DB pool. The report's
  `shed (ResourceExhausted)` ratio and the `DB-pool collapse` flag are the
  pass/fail signals: under overload the head should shed (ratio > 0) and the
  collapse flag should stay **no** (zero `DeadlineExceeded`/`Unavailable` on
  `RequestWorkUnit`). By default the profile ignores sheds and re-requests
  immediately (maximal pressure); pass `--honor-shed` to back off like a real
  client.
- **`request-only`** — a supplementary **HandOut-isolation probe**: `overload`'s
  hot `RequestWorkUnit` loop with **no** `StartWork`/`SubmitResult` (no
  pretend-compute), so it measures the pure server-side *dispatch cache* HandOut
  path — the lock/scan ceiling and head-side `RequestWorkUnit` p50/p99 vs
  concurrency — with zero write-path noise. It is how the FIX-1 lock-cliff
  removal is read in isolation. **It reserves units without recycling them, so it
  MUST be run against a generously primed ready pool and a short `--duration`**
  (large head `ready_pool_size` + `refill_batch_size` and a high `--seed-units`),
  or once the pool drains it just measures the `readyLen==0`+admission-saturated
  shed branch instead of the HandOut win. The **headline** FIX-1 number still
  comes from the `overload` before/after comparison (where units recycle via
  `StartWork` and keep the pool primed); `request-only` is a supplementary probe.

Run-start is the explicit `StartWork` RPC (one call per unit actually executed,
**not** per request); there is no per-task heartbeat, so liveness is
deadline-based. The report's per-RPC table shows `StartWork`, a `throttl`
(`ResourceExhausted` graceful shed) column, a `collaps` column (**true** head-side
DB-pool collapse: a head-side `DeadlineExceeded`/`Unavailable` while the run is
live), and a `cancel` column. **`cancel` is the known false-positive guard:** an
in-flight RPC cancelled at run shutdown — or a client-side `DeadlineExceeded` from
mere head lock-slowness as the run winds down — is recorded as `cancel`, **not**
`collaps`, so it does not falsely trip the DoD collapse flag. Read write-path
shedding (FIX 2/3) from the `StartWork`/`SubmitResult` rows' `throttl`>0 with
`collaps`==0 — **not** from the RWU-only `collapsed` headline flag / `shed_ratio`,
which are keyed only on `RequestWorkUnit` by design.

### Seeding

By default the simulator seeds an active leaf with work units over the HTTP
admin API (create → configure → update → activate → `work-units/generate`),
idempotent on the `--seed-leaf` name. Leaf creation needs a `creator_id` that
references a real user row, so pass `--creator-id` (or `SWARM_SIM_CREATOR_ID`)
the id of an existing user. Pass `--no-seed` to target a pre-existing leaf by
name without seeding.

### In-process vs standalone head

There is no in-process head harness for the simulator: it lives in a different
module from the head and cannot import the head's internal packages. Run the
simulator against a **standalone head process**:

1. Start a throwaway Postgres (a non-default host port; do **not** touch a local
   Postgres 17 service):

   ```bash
   podman run -d --name lettuce-sim-pg \
     -e POSTGRES_USER=lettuce -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=testpass -e POSTGRES_DB=lettuce \
     -p 5434:5432 docker.io/library/postgres:16-alpine
   ```

2. Run the head with TLS off on `127.0.0.1:9090` (gRPC) / `:8080` (HTTP),
   pointing at that Postgres. The head applies migrations on boot. Set
   `LETTUCE_ADMIN_API_KEY` (required) and, to provision an owner user for
   seeding, `LETTUCE_ADMIN_EMAIL` + `LETTUCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. On Windows +
   podman, the published port is reachable via the podman VM's `eth0` IP, not
   `127.0.0.1`, so set `LETTUCE_DB_HOST` to that VM IP.

3. Read the bootstrapped admin user's id from the DB (`SELECT id FROM users
   WHERE role='ADMIN'`) and pass it as `--creator-id`.

4. Run a profile:

   ```bash
   go run ./cmd/swarm-sim \
     --head-grpc=127.0.0.1:9090 --head-http=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
     --admin-key=$LETTUCE_ADMIN_API_KEY --creator-id=<admin-user-id> \
     --volunteers=25 --profile=buffered --duration=60s \
     --seed-leaf=swarm-test --seed-units=100000 \
     --buffer-hours=2 --max-assignments=8 --report=text
   ```

   Run it once per profile (`--profile=naive`, then `--profile=buffered`) to
   compare fleet `RequestWorkUnit` rate at equal dispatch throughput.

#### Ceiling / overload run (single-head dispatch ceiling + graceful shedding)

To measure the single-head dispatch ceiling and confirm the head sheds
gracefully under naive overload (the Layer 2 Definition of Done), drive the
`overload` profile with a fleet well above capacity:

```bash
go run ./cmd/swarm-sim \
  --head-grpc=127.0.0.1:9090 --head-http=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
  --admin-key=$LETTUCE_ADMIN_API_KEY --creator-id=<admin-user-id> \
  --volunteers=2000 --profile=overload --duration=60s \
  --seed-leaf=swarm-ceiling --seed-units=200000 --report=json
```

Read **`peak_dispatch_per_sec`** as the ceiling, **`shed_ratio`** as the
graceful-backpressure fraction, and **`collapsed`** (must be `false`) as the
no-pool-collapse assertion.

Two head-side knobs are required for a meaningful ceiling run:

- **Raise the gRPC rate limits.** A single-host swarm shares one source IP, so
  the Layer 0 per-IP bucket (default 60/min) would shed the fleet before the
  Layer 2 admission cap is exercised — and the `shed_ratio` would just measure
  the per-IP limiter, not the head's dispatch capacity. Raise both budgets on
  the **head process** when launching it:

  ```bash
  LETTUCE_GRPC_PER_IP_RATE_LIMIT=100000000 \
  LETTUCE_GRPC_PER_PUBKEY_RATE_LIMIT=100000000 \
  LETTUCE_GRPC_PER_IP_STREAM_LIMIT=100000000 \
  ...other env... lettuce-server --config ...
  ```

  (The first two map to `SetGRPCRateLimits`, the third to
  `SetGRPCStreamRateLimit` — the pre-decode per-IP stream budget, default
  600/min, which a single-host swarm would otherwise hit at the tap handle
  before any request is even decoded. A non-positive value leaves the default.)

- **Set the DB pool to the operator size (~60)** to reproduce the collapse
  threshold the load test originally found — the code default is 25:

  ```bash
  LETTUCE_DB_MAX_CONNS=60 ...
  ```

Run the overload profile **before** and **after** the Layer 2 changes to compare
`peak_dispatch_per_sec` against the ~240/s baseline and to confirm `collapsed`
flips from `true` (pre-Layer-2 pool collapse) to `false` (graceful shedding).

For the perf-hardening pass, run `--profile=overload` at **20/100/200/500/1000**
volunteers before vs after, comparing the per-RPC `RequestWorkUnit` p50/p99 and
`peak_dispatch_per_sec`: the headline FIX-1 result is that the head-side
`RequestWorkUnit` latency cliff under a concurrent storm (the old
sub-ms@20 → hundreds-of-ms@500 climb) is materially reduced, with `RequestWorkUnit`
still off Postgres (`collapsed`=`false`). Write-path shedding (FIX 2/3) is read
from the `StartWork`/`SubmitResult` rows' `throttl`>0, `collaps`==0 — confirm the
head returns `ResourceExhausted` instead of logging `context deadline exceeded`.

#### HandOut-isolation run (FIX-1 lock cliff, write path excluded)

To isolate the pure HandOut path from the write path, run the `request-only`
probe against a **generously primed** ready pool and a **short** duration so the
numbers are the contended HandOut, not the drained-pool shed branch:

```bash
# Head launched with a large primed pool, e.g.:
#   LETTUCE_HEAD_READY_POOL_SIZE=20000 LETTUCE_HEAD_REFILL_BATCH_SIZE=5000 \
#   LETTUCE_GRPC_PER_IP_RATE_LIMIT=100000000 LETTUCE_GRPC_PER_PUBKEY_RATE_LIMIT=100000000 \
#   LETTUCE_GRPC_PER_IP_STREAM_LIMIT=100000000 \
#   LETTUCE_DB_MAX_CONNS=60 ...other env... lettuce-server --config ...
go run ./cmd/swarm-sim \
  --head-grpc=127.0.0.1:9090 --head-http=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
  --admin-key=$LETTUCE_ADMIN_API_KEY --creator-id=<admin-user-id> \
  --volunteers=500 --profile=request-only --duration=15s \
  --seed-leaf=swarm-handout --seed-units=300000 --report=json
```

Read the `RequestWorkUnit` row's p50/p99 vs volunteer count (sweep 20/100/200/500)
as the pure HandOut latency curve. If the run reports a high `shed_ratio` or many
`RequestWorkUnit` sheds, the pool drained — raise `--seed-units` /
`ready_pool_size` / `refill_batch_size` or shorten `--duration` and re-run, since
a drained pool measures the shed branch, not the HandOut win.

### Per-client rate limiting note

The head's *per-client rate limiting* buckets gRPC callers per source IP. A
swarm run entirely from one host shares a single source IP, so a large fleet
will be throttled (`ResourceExhausted`) — this is itself a valid Layer-0
measurement, but it means request-rate numbers from a single-host swarm are
bounded by the per-IP limit. The simulator retries **registration** through the
limiter so the fleet still comes up; steady-state `RequestWorkUnit` numbers
reflect whatever the limiter allows. For a ceiling/overload run, raise the
budgets on the head with `LETTUCE_GRPC_PER_IP_RATE_LIMIT` /
`LETTUCE_GRPC_PER_PUBKEY_RATE_LIMIT` / `LETTUCE_GRPC_PER_IP_STREAM_LIMIT`
(see the ceiling-run recipe above) so the shed ratio measures the head's
dispatch admission cap, not the per-IP request bucket or the pre-decode
per-IP stream budget.

### Integration smoke test

`cmd/swarm-sim/smoke_test.go` (`//go:build integration`) runs 20 volunteers ×
5s for **both** profiles against a head you stand up out of process, and
asserts the buffered profile makes strictly fewer `RequestWorkUnit` calls than
the naive profile. It is env-gated and skips unless these are set:

```bash
export SWARM_SMOKE_GRPC=127.0.0.1:9090
export SWARM_SMOKE_HTTP=http://127.0.0.1:8080
export SWARM_SMOKE_ADMIN=$LETTUCE_ADMIN_API_KEY
export SWARM_SIM_CREATOR_ID=<admin-user-id>
go test -tags=integration -run TestSwarmSimSmoke ./cmd/swarm-sim/
```

### Calibrating `target_request_rate_per_sec`

The head's `target_request_rate_per_sec` (env
`LETTUCE_HEAD_TARGET_REQUEST_RATE_PER_SEC`, default 500) is **not** a trusted
default — it must be calibrated against the real single-head assignment ceiling
on the target hardware before the head's *server-directed retry delay* behaves
meaningfully under load. Use the simulator's reported dispatch throughput
(assignments/sec) at saturation as the measured ceiling, then set the head knob
to that value and re-run. Until calibrated, the delay curve (which keys off the
ratio of observed request rate to this target) over- or under-shoots.
