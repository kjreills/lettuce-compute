# Creating Your First Leaf

A **leaf** is a single computation running on your head. This guide takes a compute
program from your laptop to running on volunteers' machines, through the head you
deployed in **[head-setup.md](head-setup.md)**.

There are two complete walkthroughs:

- **[Path 1 — Native binary](#path-1--native-binary-leaf)** — the simplest leaf. A small
  compiled program. Start here.
- **[Path 2 — Container](#path-2--container-leaf)** — package any language (Python, R, …)
  as a container image. Use this when cross-compiling a native binary is painful.

> **This guide targets the head you deployed** (the production path in head-setup.md).
> The local dry-run stack doesn't host binaries, run a registry, or create an admin user,
> so a few steps below can't run against it — see [Testing locally](#testing-locally) at
> the end.

## How a leaf works

A leaf moves through states as you build it, and its work units move through states as
volunteers compute them:

```
Leaf:        DRAFT ──(configure)──► CONFIGURING ──(activate)──► ACTIVE
Work units:  QUEUED ──► ASSIGNED ──► COMPLETED ──► VALIDATED
```

The flow you'll follow:

```
1. build the compute artifact        (on your machine)
2. host it on your head              (binaries/ dir, or the registry)
3. create the leaf                   POST /api/v1/leafs
4. configure it                      POST .../configure  +  PUT /api/v1/leafs/{id}
5. activate it                       POST .../activate
6. generate work units               POST .../work-units/generate
7. volunteers compute                (they run the lettuce-volunteer CLI)
8. collect / aggregate results       GET .../results  /  POST .../aggregate
```

---

## Sizing your worker pool (recommended)

A volunteer's CPU allowance is a budget for the whole machine that every running
task shares equally, and the volunteer client caps each task at its share (a
container CPU quota, a cgroup or Job Object cap for native work). Inside a
container `os.cpu_count()` / `runtime.NumCPU()` / `nproc` still report every CPU
of the machine, so a program that sizes its thread pool from them oversubscribes
its cap and stalls on throttling instead of computing.

Size the pool from what the task was actually given instead. The client sets, for
every runtime:

- **`LETTUCE_CPU_LIMIT`** — the task's share in cores, possibly fractional (`2`,
  `1.5`, `0.5`). Round it to whole threads, never below one.
- **`OMP_NUM_THREADS`, `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS`, `MKL_NUM_THREADS`,
  `NUMEXPR_MAX_THREADS`** — the same figure as a whole thread count, which
  OpenMP, NumPy/SciPy (OpenBLAS/MKL) and numexpr read on their own; a library
  that honours them needs no code change.

```python
import math, os
workers = max(1, round(float(os.environ.get("LETTUCE_CPU_LIMIT", "1"))))
```

```go
limit, _ := strconv.ParseFloat(os.Getenv("LETTUCE_CPU_LIMIT"), 64)
workers := max(1, int(math.Round(limit)))
```

On Linux the same figure can be read from the cgroup (`/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.max`:
quota ÷ period). The share is fixed for the life of the process — the cap moves
when other tasks on the machine start or finish, but a running process is not
told — so read it once at start-up and do not re-derive it from the CPU count.

---

## Reporting progress (recommended)

Have your entrypoint report progress so contributors can see how far along a work
unit is. Periodically write a single number `0`–`100` (the percent complete) to the
file named by the `$LETTUCE_PROGRESS_FILE` environment variable. The volunteer reads
it and `lettuce-volunteer status` shows live progress and an ETA — without it, a
running unit shows a flat `0%` until it finishes.

The volunteer sets `$LETTUCE_PROGRESS_FILE` for **both** runtimes:

- **native** → `<work-dir>/progress.txt`
- **container** → `/work/output/progress.txt`

Both example programs in this guide already do it — write progress from the main loop,
make it best-effort (swallow any error; never fail the unit), and ideally write
atomically (temp file + rename) so a reader never sees a half-written value:

```go
// guides/examples/monte-carlo-pi/main.go (native, Go) — throttled to ~every 5s
progressFile := os.Getenv("LETTUCE_PROGRESS_FILE")
if progressFile != "" && time.Since(lastProgress) >= 5*time.Second {
    pct := float64(i+1) / float64(dartsPerTrial) * 100
    os.WriteFile(progressFile, []byte(fmt.Sprintf("%.1f", pct)), 0644)
    lastProgress = time.Now()
}
```

```python
# guides/examples/nbody-gravity/simulate.py (container, Python) — throttled to ~every 5s
progress_file = os.environ.get("LETTUCE_PROGRESS_FILE")
if progress_file and time.time() - last_progress >= 5.0:
    with open(progress_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(f"{(step + 1) / num_steps * 100:.1f}")
    last_progress = time.time()
```

---

## Checkpointing (optional, for long work units)

By default an interrupted work unit — the volunteer is stopped or updated, the
machine reboots, or the unit is reassigned to another volunteer — **starts over
from the beginning** and redoes all the work it had already done. For short
units that is fine. For long ones it wastes the contributor's compute and resets
the progress bar. A leaf that checkpoints resumes from roughly where it left off.

Checkpointing is **opt-in** and needs the leaf to cooperate; the infrastructure
cannot snapshot arbitrary in-progress computation for you. Enable it in the
leaf's `fault_tolerance_config` with `checkpointing_enabled: true` and
`checkpoint_interval_seconds` (minimum `60`) — that interval bounds how much work
is ever at risk — then honor the contract in the entrypoint:

- The runtime creates a per-unit checkpoint **directory** and names it in
  `$LETTUCE_CHECKPOINT_DIR` (native → `<work-dir>/checkpoint`; container →
  `/work/checkpoint`; wasm → `/work/checkpoint`). `$LETTUCE_CHECKPOINT_FILE` is a
  convenience path inside it for single-file state — the whole directory is what
  gets archived and restored.
- **Save** resumable state into that directory periodically (e.g. "completed N of
  M items" plus partial results). Write it **atomically** (temp file in the same
  directory, then rename over the target) so a checkpoint captured — or the
  process killed — mid-write never leaves a torn file for the next run.
- **Resume on startup**: if the directory already holds a checkpoint, load it,
  continue from there, and re-emit the matching `$LETTUCE_PROGRESS_FILE` value so
  progress does not reset. The same directory is populated whether the unit
  resumed on the same volunteer (its work dir is preserved) or was reassigned to
  a new one (the head's latest checkpoint is restored into it first), so one
  resume path covers both.

On a graceful stop the leaf is sent `SIGTERM` with a short grace window before it
is killed; trapping it to flush one final checkpoint reduces the work lost on a
clean stop to nearly zero (optional — the interval already bounds the loss).
Keep checkpoint writes best-effort (never fail the unit on a write error) and
within `max_checkpoint_size_bytes` (default 100 MB).

---

## Updating a leaf's artifact — versions & rollback

When you change a leaf's compute artifact (a new native binary, or a new container
image), publish it as an **immutable version** so already-RUNNING volunteers pick it up
automatically — no restart, no manual `podman pull`:

```
# 1. Update the artifact as usual: scp the new binary + set the new checksum, OR push
#    a NEW immutable image tag/digest; then PUT the new execution_config.
# 2. Publish it as a named, immutable version (activates it by default):
curl -s -X POST $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/versions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LETTUCE_ADMIN_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"version_label":"native-go-2.0","notes":"3D rewrite"}'
```

The head stamps the current version into every new assignment, so a running volunteer
runs the new artifact on its **next work request** (within the leaf-snapshot TTL, ~30s)
— no restart. Old in-flight work finishes on its pinned version, and redundant copies
of one work unit always run the same version (homogeneous redundancy).

- **List history:** `GET /api/v1/leafs/{id}/versions`
- **Roll back / re-point:** `POST /api/v1/leafs/{id}/versions/{version_id}/activate`
- **Container leaves must be immutable:** publishing **rejects a `:latest` image** —
  pin a digest (`repo@sha256:…`) or an immutable tag (`:2.0`). A re-pushed `:latest` is
  never re-pulled by volunteers, the exact bug this versioning fixes.
- **Don't garbage-collect a published image's blobs while units still reference it.**
  Work units are pinned to the artifact version that was current when they were
  generated. If you push a new image and a registry GC removes the **old version's
  blobs**, its manifest may still resolve (200) while its layers 404 — volunteers
  pinned to it can no longer pull, and the failure can surface only as a confusing
  `container create: no such image` at run time. If you intend the old image to go
  away, first move the affected QUEUED units onto the new version (regenerate them, or
  re-point them and restart the head); otherwise keep the old blobs (disable registry
  blob GC / `retention=all`). This bit a live head on 2026-06-27.

---

## Before you start

You'll run the API calls from anywhere with `curl` (your laptop or the server). Set two
variables — your head's URL and the admin API key you generated in head-setup.md, Step 6:

```bash
HEAD="https://your-domain.com"
ADMIN_KEY="<your LETTUCE_ADMIN_API_KEY from .env>"
```

Every leaf is owned by a user. Get your admin user's ID — run this **on the server**, from
the `lettuce-compute` directory:

```bash
CREATOR_ID=$(docker compose -f compose.production.yaml exec -T postgres \
  psql -U lettuce -d lettuce -tA -c "SELECT id FROM users WHERE role='ADMIN' ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 1")
echo "$CREATOR_ID"
```

That prints a UUID (e.g. `3f1c…`). The admin user was created automatically on first boot
from `LETTUCE_ADMIN_EMAIL`/`LETTUCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, so its ID is unique to your head.

---

## Path 1 — Native binary leaf

We'll use the **[monte-carlo-pi](examples/monte-carlo-pi/)** example: a tiny Go program
that estimates π by throwing random darts. Each work unit is one trial; the head averages
them into a final estimate of π.

### Step 1 — Build the binary

The program reads `LETTUCE_PARAMS_FILE` and writes its result to `LETTUCE_OUTPUT_FILE`.
Cross-compile for whatever platforms your volunteers run (Linux and Windows shown):

```bash
cd guides/examples/monte-carlo-pi
GOWORK=off GOOS=linux   GOARCH=amd64 go build -o monte-carlo-pi-linux .
GOWORK=off GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o monte-carlo-pi.exe   .
```

> **Why `GOWORK=off`?** You are building inside a clone of this repository, whose
> root carries a Go *workspace* file (`go.work`) listing only the two server
> modules. The example is its own module and is deliberately not in that list, so
> without `GOWORK=off` the build stops with *"current directory is contained in a
> module that is not one of the workspace modules listed in go.work"*. `GOWORK=off`
> ignores the workspace for that one command and changes nothing else — and it is
> harmless everywhere, so keep it if you copy these lines elsewhere. If you copied
> the example **out** of the repository (or wrote your own compute binary from
> scratch), there is no workspace file above it and you do not need the prefix.

### Step 2 — Test it locally (recommended)

```bash
echo '{"seed": 42}' > params.json
LETTUCE_PARAMS_FILE=params.json LETTUCE_OUTPUT_FILE=out.json \
  LETTUCE_PROGRESS_FILE=progress.txt ./monte-carlo-pi-linux
cat progress.txt   # a number 0-100 (100 when done) — what `status` displays
cat out.json       # {"result": 3.14..., "seed": 42, ...}
```

If `out.json` has a `result` near 3.14, the binary honors the contract, and
`progress.txt` confirms it reports progress (see [Reporting progress](#reporting-progress-recommended)).

### Step 3 — Host the binary on your head

Copy the binaries into the head's `binaries/` directory — Caddy serves that directory at
`/binaries/`:

```bash
scp monte-carlo-pi-linux monte-carlo-pi.exe \
  root@your-domain.com:~/lettuce-compute/binaries/
```

Confirm they're reachable (expect `HTTP/2 200`):

```bash
curl -sI https://your-domain.com/binaries/monte-carlo-pi-linux | head -1
```

Now compute the SHA-256 of each binary. NATIVE leafs **require** a checksum per
platform — volunteers verify the download against it before running it and refuse
to execute an unverified or tampered binary (this protects volunteers from a
corrupted download, a MITM, or a compromised artifact host):

```bash
# Linux
sha256sum monte-carlo-pi-linux monte-carlo-pi.exe

# macOS
shasum -a 256 monte-carlo-pi-linux monte-carlo-pi.exe

# Windows PowerShell (one file at a time; output is UPPERCASE — lowercase it before pasting)
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 monte-carlo-pi-linux | ForEach-Object { $_.Hash.ToLower() }
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 monte-carlo-pi.exe   | ForEach-Object { $_.Hash.ToLower() }
```

Each digest is a **64-character lowercase hex** string — keep them for Step 5.
Compute them on the **exact file you uploaded** (the digest must match the
bytes served at the URL). If you computed on Windows, make sure you converted
the hash to lowercase: the server rejects uppercase or non-hex values at
configure time.

### Step 4 — Create the leaf

```bash
LEAF_ID=$(curl -s -X POST $HEAD/api/v1/leafs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -d "{
    \"name\": \"Monte Carlo Pi\",
    \"description\": \"Estimate the value of pi by random dart-throwing.\",
    \"research_area\": [\"mathematics\"],
    \"task_pattern\": \"MONTE_CARLO\",
    \"visibility\": \"PUBLIC\",
    \"creator_id\": \"$CREATOR_ID\"
  }" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['id'])")
echo "Leaf: $LEAF_ID"
```

The leaf starts in `DRAFT`. (`research_area` values are slugs — `mathematics`, `physics`,
`biology`, `chemistry`, `climate`, `computer-science`, `engineering`, `ml-ai`, …)

**`visibility` decides who can find your leaf — and therefore who computes it:**

| Value | Listed publicly? | Who computes it |
|---|---|---|
| `PUBLIC` | Yes — in the head's public leaf catalog and on the dashboard. | Every attached volunteer picks it up automatically. This is what you want for most leafs. |
| `UNLISTED` | No — absent from the catalog; reachable by anyone who has the leaf ID. | Only volunteers that explicitly pin it: `lettuce-volunteer attach <leaf-id>` (or `attach --server <host> --leaf <leaf-id>`). Volunteers that merely attached your head never see it. |
| `PRIVATE` | No — hidden except to its creator/admins. | Same as UNLISTED on the volunteer side: only an explicit `attach <leaf-id>` reaches it. |

An `UNLISTED` or `PRIVATE` leaf gets **zero** volunteers until each one runs
`lettuce-volunteer attach <leaf-id>` — share the leaf ID with the people you want
computing it, and have them restart their daemon after attaching. If you set a
non-public visibility and wonder why nothing is being computed, this is why.

### Step 5 — Configure it

Move the leaf to `CONFIGURING`, then set how it runs and how results are validated:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/configure \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" > /dev/null

curl -s -X PUT $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -d '{

      "binaries": {
        "linux_amd64":   "'"$HEAD"'/binaries/monte-carlo-pi-linux",
        "windows_amd64": "'"$HEAD"'/binaries/monte-carlo-pi.exe"
      },
      "binary_checksums": {

      },
      "max_input_size_bytes": 1048576,

What the key settings mean:

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `runtime: NATIVE` | Volunteers run a compiled binary (matched to their OS/arch). |
| `binaries` | Download URLs per platform. Volunteers fetch the one that matches them. |
| `binary_checksums` | SHA-256 (lowercase hex) of each binary. **Required for NATIVE.** Volunteers verify the download and refuse to run a binary whose hash doesn't match. |
| `max_cpu_seconds: 30` | Volunteer kills the binary after 30s of CPU time. |
| `redundancy_factor: 1` | Each work unit goes to one volunteer. Set 2+ and the unit is sent to that many volunteers **in parallel**; their results are cross-checked and the unit validates once `agreement_threshold` of them agree (e.g. `3` + `0.67` ⇒ 2 of 3). This is the simple knob: it sets **both** how many copies to dispatch and how many must agree. To decouple them, use `target_copies` + `min_quorum` below. |
| `target_copies` / `min_quorum` (optional) | Split `redundancy_factor` into how many copies to **dispatch** (`target_copies`) vs how many agreeing results **validate** (`min_quorum`), with `min_quorum ≤ target_copies`. Setting `target_copies` higher than `min_quorum` over-dispatches and validates as soon as a quorum agrees, **without waiting for the stragglers** — it absorbs vanished/slow volunteers without a serial re-dispatch round-trip (e.g. `target_copies: 3, min_quorum: 2` ⇒ send 3, validate on the first 2 that agree; the extra copy is dropped without penalty). Omit both ⇒ `target_copies = min_quorum = redundancy_factor` (unchanged behavior). |
| `comparison_mode: NUMERIC_TOLERANCE` | Results agree if within `numeric_tolerance`. Monte Carlo is stochastic, so exact match won't do. |
| `compare_fields` / `ignore_fields` (important with redundancy ≥ 2) | Which output fields the comparison covers. **Without them, every field of the output JSON is compared** — including non-semantic fields like `compute_time_ms`, which differ between two honest volunteers and would make their otherwise-matching results DISAGREE. Set `compare_fields` to the science that must match (here the `result` field), or `ignore_fields` to drop known-noisy fields. With `redundancy_factor: 1` nothing is ever compared, but set it anyway so raising redundancy later doesn't silently start rejecting honest results. |
| `agreement_threshold: 1.0` | Fraction of the redundant copies that must agree to validate (the quorum). `1.0` = unanimous. |
| `max_total_copies` / `max_error_copies` (optional) | Hard caps that bound a non-converging unit. `max_total_copies` is the dead-letter ceiling (default `target_copies + 6`): once this many copies have been created with the quorum still unmet, the unit is parked `FAILED` (recoverable by the operator via the work-unit `revive` endpoint — see the head-setup guide). `max_error_copies` bounds timed-out/abandoned/disagreeing copies (default unlimited); when set it must be at least `target_copies`, so an honest run of expiries alone cannot trip it. Copies a volunteer returns **unused** because its work buffer could not hold them count toward neither cap, and a volunteer that abandons a unit **without ever starting it** (an unreachable container engine, no runtime, a prepare failure) counts **once** toward both caps however often it repeats — only real attempts, and distinct volunteers' failures, spend a unit's budget. Both operator-tunable per leaf; omit for the defaults. |
| `deadline_multiplier: 3.0` | Sets each work unit's timeout. By default `deadline_seconds = 3600 × multiplier` (so `3.0` = 3h, `0.5` = 30min); set an explicit `deadline_seconds` (next row) to give an absolute deadline instead. Any value, no cap. **Stamped at generation** — changing it only affects newly generated units. A copy not returned by its deadline is redispatched to another volunteer (no per-attempt cap; a hopeless unit eventually dead-letters after `redundancy_factor + 6` total copies). `max_reassignments` is a deprecated no-op, kept only so older configs still validate. |
| `deadline_seconds` (optional) | An absolute per-work-unit deadline in seconds that **overrides** `deadline_multiplier` when set — use it to match the deadline to how long a unit really takes (and to how long your volunteers tend to pause), instead of the fixed 3600s baseline. Must be > 0; for no hard deadline use `no_deadline: true` instead. At activation the head logs the resolved deadline and **warns when it is shorter than `max_cpu_seconds`** — the case where a unit that uses its full CPU budget could never be returned in time. |
| `aggregation_config.output_field: "result"` | The JSON field the aggregator reads from each result (the π estimate). |
| `max_output_size_bytes: 10485760` | Hard cap (bytes) on a single result payload — the server **rejects** larger submissions. Must be > 0; size it to the largest reasonable result for this leaf. |

### Step 6 — Activate and generate work units

```bash
curl -s -X POST $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/activate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" > /dev/null

curl -s -X POST $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/work-units/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -d '{"parameter_space": {"num_trials": 100}}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

This creates 100 work units, each a Monte Carlo trial with its own seed.

### Step 7 — Verify

```bash
# Leaf should be ACTIVE
curl -s $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID | python3 -m json.tool | grep '"state"'

# Work units should be QUEUED
curl -s "$HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/work-units?state=QUEUED&limit=3" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Or open `https://your-domain.com/dashboard/leafs` and you'll see the leaf listed as
ACTIVE with queued work.

### Step 8 — Compute and aggregate

Attach a volunteer (your own machine works, to see it end-to-end):

```bash
lettuce-volunteer init --server your-domain.com
lettuce-volunteer start
```

Once work units finish, aggregate the trials into a final answer:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/aggregate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" | python3 -m json.tool
```

You should see a `mean` close to **3.14159** with a tight confidence interval. That's your
first leaf, computed by volunteers and aggregated by your head.

---

## Path 2 — Container leaf

When cross-compiling is painful, ship a container image instead. We'll use the
**[nbody-gravity](examples/nbody-gravity/)** example — a Python + NumPy gravitational
simulation. (Any language works; the container just has to honor the contract.)

The container contract differs slightly from native: read parameters from
`LETTUCE_PARAMETERS_FILE`, write results to `LETTUCE_OUTPUT_DIR/output.json`.

Build and push with **Podman** (the runtime volunteers use). `docker` is a drop-in
alternative for every command below.

### Step 1 — Build the image

Tag it with your head's domain so it can be pushed to the head's registry. Use an
**immutable version tag** (`:1.0`), not `:latest`: container leaves must be immutable
(see the callout above), and the head **rejects `:latest` and untagged images at
version-publish time** — starting from a pinned tag means the artifact-update flow
works later without retagging:

```bash
cd guides/examples/nbody-gravity
podman build -t your-domain.com/nbody:1.0 .
```

### Step 2 — Test it locally (recommended)

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/nbody/input /tmp/nbody/output
echo '{"num_bodies":100,"spread":5.0,"velocity_scale":0.5,"mass_distribution":"uniform","timestep":0.01,"num_steps":1000}' \
  > /tmp/nbody/input/parameters.json

podman run --rm \
  -v /tmp/nbody/input:/work/input:ro \
  -v /tmp/nbody/output:/work/output \
  -e LETTUCE_PARAMETERS_FILE=/work/input/parameters.json \
  -e LETTUCE_OUTPUT_DIR=/work/output \
  -e LETTUCE_PROGRESS_FILE=/work/output/progress.txt \
  your-domain.com/nbody:1.0

cat /tmp/nbody/output/progress.txt   # a number 0-100 (100 when done) — what `status` displays
cat /tmp/nbody/output/output.json
```

### Step 3 — Push to your head's registry

Your head runs an image registry at `/v2/`. Push needs the registry credentials from
head-setup.md, Step 6 (volunteers pull anonymously):

```bash
podman login your-domain.com -u lettuce        # password = your REGISTRY password
podman push your-domain.com/nbody:1.0
```

> **Heads-up:** `podman login` prints "Login Succeeded" without actually checking the
> password (the registry's login ping is anonymous — pulls are public). A typo'd
> password surfaces only later, as an `authentication required` error at `podman push`.
> If a push fails that way, re-run `podman login` and re-enter the password.

### Step 4 — Create the leaf

```bash
LEAF_ID=$(curl -s -X POST $HEAD/api/v1/leafs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -d "{
    \"name\": \"N-Body Gravity\",
    \"description\": \"Gravitational N-body star cluster simulation.\",
    \"research_area\": [\"physics\"],
    \"task_pattern\": \"PARAMETER_SWEEP\",
    \"visibility\": \"PUBLIC\",
    \"creator_id\": \"$CREATOR_ID\"
  }" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['id'])")
echo "Leaf: $LEAF_ID"
```

### Step 5 — Configure it (CONTAINER runtime)

Container leafs use `image` instead of `binaries`. The simulation is deterministic, so
results can be compared with `EXACT`:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/configure \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" > /dev/null

curl -s -X PUT $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "execution_config": {
      "runtime": "CONTAINER",
      "image": "your-domain.com/nbody:1.0",
      "gpu_required": false,
      "max_memory_mb": 512,
      "max_disk_mb": 256,
      "max_cpu_seconds": 300
    },
    "validation_config": {
      "redundancy_factor": 1,
      "agreement_threshold": 1.0,
      "comparison_mode": "EXACT",
      "max_retries": 3
    },
    "fault_tolerance_config": {
      "deadline_multiplier": 3.0,
      "max_reassignments": 3
    },
    "data_config": {
      "transfer_strategy": "INLINE",
      "max_input_size_bytes": 1048576,
      "max_output_size_bytes": 10485760
    }
  }' > /dev/null
```

> The `image` value is just the registry path **without** the `https://` scheme — e.g.
> `your-domain.com/nbody:1.0`. Volunteers without a container runtime skip container
> leafs automatically.

### Step 6 — Activate and generate work units

Start small. The parameter space is expanded into a **Cartesian product** — one work unit
per combination:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/activate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" > /dev/null

curl -s -X POST $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/work-units/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "parameter_space": {
      "num_bodies": [100, 200],
      "spread": [5.0],
      "velocity_scale": [0.5],
      "mass_distribution": ["uniform"],
      "timestep": [0.01],
      "num_steps": [1000]
    }
  }' | python3 -m json.tool
```

That's 2 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 = **2 work units**. Add more values to any list to grow the
sweep.

### Step 7 — Verify

Same as the native path — check the leaf is `ACTIVE` and work units are `QUEUED`, then
attach a volunteer with a container runtime to compute them:

```bash
curl -s $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID | python3 -m json.tool | grep '"state"'
curl -s "$HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/work-units?state=QUEUED" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Operating your leaf

```bash
# Pause (stop handing out new work) / resume
curl -s -X POST $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/pause  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY"
curl -s -X POST $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/resume -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY"

# Add more work units later (same endpoint, new parameters)
curl -s -X POST $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/work-units/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -d '{"parameter_space": {"num_trials": 50}}'

# Collect validated results
curl -s "$HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/results" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" | python3 -m json.tool

# Archive when you're done (after collecting results)
curl -s -X POST $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID/archive -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY"
```

### Making a leaf's visualization public (`results_visibility`)

By default a leaf's **results are private**: the dashboard's visualization page
(`/leafs/<slug>/visualize`) and its replay data are visible only to the leaf's owner and
admins, even when the leaf itself is `PUBLIC` in the catalog. That is deliberate — a
result's `output_data` is the leaf's content, and catalog visibility only controls who
can *find* the leaf, not who can read what it computed.

If you want anyone — including visitors who are not signed in — to watch a leaf's
visualization, opt that one leaf in by setting its `results_visibility` field:

```bash
# Make this leaf's visualization and replay results publicly viewable
curl -s -X PUT $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -d '{"results_visibility": "PUBLIC"}'

# Back to the default (owner/admin only)
curl -s -X PUT $HEAD/api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -d '{"results_visibility": "OWNER_ONLY"}'
```

**Know what you are publishing.** `PUBLIC` here exposes the leaf's submitted results —
the full `output_data` each work unit produced, validated or not, replayed through the
leaf's visualization — to any anonymous visitor. Opt in only leaves whose results you
consider publishable. The opt-in is per-leaf and additive: every other leaf keeps the
default, and a `PRIVATE` leaf stays completely hidden even if its `results_visibility`
is `PUBLIC`. Once opted in, the leaf's public catalog page also shows the **Visualize**
button to everyone (for leaves that ship a viz bundle). Each change is recorded in the
head's audit log with the actor and the before/after values. Changes reach anonymous
viewers within about a minute (the dashboard caches pages and verdicts briefly).

### Why is my leaf getting no volunteers?

Work only flows when a volunteer can *find* the leaf, *run* its runtime, and *fit* its
resource needs. Check these in order:

1. **Visibility.** An `UNLISTED`/`PRIVATE` leaf is absent from the head's catalog, so
   volunteers never discover it on their own — each one must run
   `lettuce-volunteer attach <leaf-id>` (see the visibility table in Step 4) and
   restart their daemon.
2. **State.** Only `ACTIVE` leafs dispatch; check `"state"` on
   `GET /api/v1/leafs/$LEAF_ID` (a `PAUSED` leaf hands out nothing).
3. **Runtime trust.** NATIVE and CONTAINER runs are per-head opt-ins on the volunteer
   side (`lettuce-volunteer heads trust <head> …`); a WASM-only volunteer never takes
   your NATIVE leaf. `lettuce-volunteer doctor` on the volunteer shows what it will run.
4. **Resource fit.** A volunteer only receives units whose declared memory/disk fit
   under its configured limits — an oversized `max_memory_mb` silently matches nobody.

## Testing locally

The local dry-run stack from head-setup.md (`compose.yaml`) is great for confirming the
server runs, but it can't do the full leaf flow above out of the box, because it has **no
Caddy/binaries directory, no registry, and no admin user** — and both the head and the
volunteer deliberately refuse plain-HTTP, private-network artifact URLs unless you opt in
explicitly. To experiment entirely locally:

1. **Create an admin user** so you have a `creator_id`: add `LETTUCE_ADMIN_EMAIL` and
   `LETTUCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to the `infrastructure` service in `compose.yaml`, then
   `docker compose up -d`. Look up the ID with the same `psql` query as above (using
   `docker compose` without the `-f compose.production.yaml` flag).
2. **Host the binary yourself** — e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8000` in a directory, and
   point `binaries` at `http://<your-ip>:8000/...`.
3. **Let the head accept plain-HTTP binary URLs.** Leaf configuration refuses `http://`
   binary URLs by default (`must use https scheme`). For local testing only, add
   `LETTUCE_BINARY_URL_ALLOW_INSECURE=true` to the `infrastructure` service environment
   and restart it. The head logs a SECURITY warning at boot while this is set; never set
   it on a real deployment.
4. **Let your volunteer fetch artifacts from private/loopback addresses.** The
   volunteer's network guard screens every artifact download (binary, WASM module,
   external input, viz bundle) against the resolved IP and refuses loopback and
   private-network addresses, so a malicious leaf can't probe a volunteer's home
   network. That includes your `http://<your-ip>:8000/...` URLs. For local testing,
   start the daemon with your own head explicitly opted in:

   ```bash
   LETTUCE_VOLUNTEER_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ARTIFACTS=localhost lettuce-volunteer start
   ```

   The value is a comma-separated list of head names exactly as configured at `attach`
   (shown by `lettuce-volunteer status`; a head attached without a name is listed by
   its address). Only work dispatched by a listed head is exempted — downloads for
   every other head keep the full guard — and every exempted download is WARN-logged.
   There is no wildcard. Checksum verification and download size caps still apply.
   Don't leave this set when attaching to heads you don't operate yourself.
5. **For a NATIVE leaf, trust your own head for native execution** (native is a
   per-head opt-in and off by default): `lettuce-volunteer heads trust localhost native`,
   or attach with `--trust native`.
6. Use `HEAD="http://localhost:8080"` and the dev admin key
   `dev-admin-key-not-for-production`.

In practice, most people just run the walkthrough against their real head. When in doubt,
deploy the head (it's ~20 minutes) and create your first leaf there.
