// --- Layer 2/3: in-process dispatch cache (per-replica, claim-on-refill) -------
//
// The dispatch cache takes Postgres OFF the RequestWorkUnit hot path. A background
// refiller bulk-fetches QUEUED, dispatch-eligible units into an in-memory ready
// pool; RequestWorkUnit serves reservations from that pool in memory (zero DB I/O
// on the hot path); a background flusher writes the reservations to Postgres
// asynchronously in batched multi-row UPDATEs.
//
// It is an in-memory MIRROR of the existing Layer-1 reservation-columns model, not
// a new ASSIGNED-at-handout model: a hand-out produces a reservation (the unit
// stays state='QUEUED'), exactly as ReserveNextAssignable did, so every Layer-1
// correctness property (no double-reserve, per-volunteer inflight cap, redundancy,
// spot-check, runtime/capability eligibility, blocked leafs, the reservation lease)
// is preserved. Run-start (QUEUED->ASSIGNED + active history row) is a separate
// explicit StartWork step.
//
// HORIZONTAL SCALE-OUT (Layer 3, claim-on-refill): each replica runs its OWN cache
// against the SHARED Postgres. The refill is NOT a plain SELECT but an atomic
// ClaimDispatchableBatch UPDATE that stamps a per-head dispatch claim
// (dispatch_claimed_by = this replica's instance id, dispatch_claim_expires_at = a
// short lease) on each staged unit. A unit one replica stages is invisible to every
// other replica's refill (its claim is live and owned by another head), so two
// replicas can NEVER double-hand the same QUEUED unit. The claim is amortized at
// bulk-refill, so the per-request hand-out hot path stays 100% in memory. A held
// unit's claim is renewed off the hot path by the async reservation flush. When no
// head id is configured (single-replica) the cache uses the claim-free Layer-2
// refill/flush — identical behavior, no DB column writes for claims.
//
// CRASH SAFETY: the cache is an optimization over the source-of-truth Postgres.
//   - An unflushed reservation lost at crash leaves the unit plain QUEUED in PG ->
//     immediately re-dispatchable. Its dispatch claim simply EXPIRES (the crashed
//     owner stopped renewing it) and the unit becomes re-claimable by any survivor
//     on its next refill — passive expiry is the reclaim guarantee, no active sweep
//     is required for correctness (the leader-gated hygiene sweep only tidies).
//   - A flushed-as-reserved unit whose in-memory owner vanished is reclaimed by the
//     lapsed-reservation sweep (FindLapsedReservations, WP-HEAD-DEADLINE) once
//     reserved_until passes.
//   - In-memory counters are rebuilt lazily / reconciled from authoritative DB
//     counts on the reconcile tick, so crash/drift cannot cause permanent
//     over-admission or stranding.

	//
	//   1. Blocker 2 — the ready pool still holds units, so the requester is starved by a
	//      different leaf monopolizing the pool (the watermark refill never notices, since
	//      the pool is "full").
	//   2. PB-16 — the requested leaf is non-PUBLIC. The global refill's visibility gate
	//      (PB-38) stages PUBLIC leafs only, so an UNLISTED/PRIVATE leaf's units NEVER
	//      enter the ready pool through it, at any watermark; a leaf-scoped refill is the
	//      ONLY way they are staged.
	//
	// Two successive predictive gates have lived here and BOTH starved a pinned volunteer
	// indefinitely, which is why there is no third. The first was `readyNonEmpty` — a
	// stand-in for "the watermark refill is already about to stage everything dispatchable,
	// so a second leaf-scoped query would be duplicate work". That was exact while the
	// global refill spanned every ACTIVE leaf; PB-38's visibility gate broke the
	// equivalence, and on a head whose only ACTIVE leafs are UNLISTED/PRIVATE the pool is
	// permanently empty, so the gate stayed shut forever. The second was a coverage check
	// that skipped the refill when every named leaf was warmed in the leaf cache AND
	// PUBLIC. It read `peekLeaf`, and nothing in the head ever invalidates that snapshot:
	// `warmLeaf` will not refresh an entry that already exists, and the only refresher
	// (`getLeaf`'s leafSnapshotTTL) runs solely while building an ACCEPTED hand-out — the
	// one thing the starvation prevents. A leaf warmed while PUBLIC and later set UNLISTED
	// therefore read as "covered" permanently: 50 polls over 147 s produced zero hand-outs
	// and zero refills on a live head, and only a restart (which drops the cache) cured it.
	//
	// The economy this gate was protecting is carried by machinery that does not have to
	// predict anything: requestLeafRefill COALESCES repeat requests per leaf id, the single
	// refiller goroutine SERIALIZES the resulting queries, and each one runs under the
	// maintenance admission budget. Measured on a live head, that is nowhere near binding —
	// ~2 000 hammered polls pinning nonexistent leaf ids produced 10 leaf-scoped refills,
	// no admission saturation, and no regression in control dispatch latency. A redundant

//	(a) cand.trustedContributors — the refill-time snapshot of contributor subjects that

//	    submission-time score). FROZEN: these are taken as-is and never re-scored, because a
//	    pending author's verdict counts its stamped score, so re-scoring it against a later
//	    current value would diverge from what validation will actually credit.
//	(b) the current in-memory holds (heldCopy.subject) whose CURRENT snapshot score meets
//	    the floor AND whose ACCOUNT's current standing is OK — post-refill live copies,
//	    evaluated live. A neutralized (PROBATION/BENCHED) holder cannot corroborate, so it is
//	    not trusted-present even if its subject scores above the floor (account standing,
//	    BG-24b) — the live-arm twin of the standing filter now in trustedContributorSubjectsSQL.
//	(c) cand.runStartedSubjects — subjects converted from a hold to a RUNNING copy after
//	    staging (onRunStart), also post-refill live copies, evaluated by CURRENT score the
//	    same way as (b). Kept apart from (a) precisely so a refill-time pending author is
//	    never swept into the live-scored set. UNLIKE (a) and (b), arm (c) is deliberately NOT
//	    standing-filtered (BG-24b): runStartedSubjects are bare subject strings with no
//	    account id to resolve against the standing snapshot. The error direction is bounded
//	    and safe — a neutralized run-started subject can only OVER-count trusted_present,
//	    which makes the in-memory reservation verdict slightly MORE permissive (it may admit
//	    an untrusted requester the reservation would otherwise withhold), and that
//	    self-corrects at the standing-filtered SQL landing (a voided hand-out at worst — the
//	    #86/#87 staleness class), never a wrong LANDED copy. Tightening it would require
//	    stamping account ids onto run-started entries; evaluated and skipped as net-new
