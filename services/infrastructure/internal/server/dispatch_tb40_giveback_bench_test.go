// TB-40 regression tests: a give-back (or mid-run abandon) closed the volunteer's
// copy in SQL — starting the authoritative re-offer cooldown — but never recorded
// that close on the still-staged candidate's bench map, a refill-time snapshot that
// refreshes only on re-stage. eligibleLocked read the stale snapshot, admitted the
// closer's next poll, and handed out a reservation the SQL landing was guaranteed to
// refuse; the client was never told and buffered a phantom that died at run-start
// (~14 % of fleet slot starts on 2026-08-02, two idle-slot episodes per affected
// host).
//
// The close-time bench must mirror the SQL cooldown gate (cooldownGuardSQL) EXACTLY:
// RETURNED benches the short re-offer throttle and any ABANDONED benches ~one
// deadline. (Until TB-81 an un-started ABANDONED benched nothing, the #59 exemption
// for graceful buffer returns; those returns are RETURNED give-backs now, and an
// un-started ABANDONED is a failure to start the unit — see
// dispatch_tb81_tb82_test.go.)
//
// Red evidence (2026-08-03, pre-fix tree, tests in place): both bench tests failed
// with "hand-out inside the ... cooldown = 1 results, want 0" — the handler released
// the hold and nothing benched, so the same volunteer was re-offered the unit it had
// just closed.
