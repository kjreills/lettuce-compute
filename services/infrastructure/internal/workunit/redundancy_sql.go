// ResolveTrust across a grid of gate / leaf-override / default / min-quorum inputs — the
// same structural guard subjectExprSQL has against a silent Go<->SQL divergence.
//
// Each builder takes the leafs (and, for K, the work_units) alias in scope plus the $N
// placeholders carrying the head TrustDispatchPolicy fields (gate-enabled, default K,
// default floor). Resolution mirrors ResolveTrust field-for-field: per-leaf override
// (validation_config, 0 = none) -> head default. Because the gate-off branch resolves K to
// a constant 0, the reservation clause that embeds effTrustKSQL collapses to the
// pre-existing redundancy headroom check when the gate is off — provably inert, exactly as
// ResolveTrust returns K == 0 with the gate disabled.

// effTrustFloorSQL: the resolved trust floor W. Mirrors ResolveTrust's floor branch

// its trust_floor and the head default, never the leaf's value outright) plus the
// unconditional >= 1 clamp (a floor of 0 would make every score-0 account a trusted witness
// for accrual). The old "leaf when > 0 else default" CASE collapses into GREATEST because
// both branches are now max'd: COALESCE(..., 0) supplies a stored leaf floor (0 when absent),
// and GREATEST with the head default handles negative stored values IDENTICALLY to the Go
// max() (validation pins trust_floor >= 0 at leaf create, but this SQL stays safe for any
// stored value). Resolved REGARDLESS of the gate switch, exactly as ResolveTrust resolves the
// floor even when disabled (accrual needs the real floor before enforcement is ever turned on,

// and full replication is FORCED around it. ReserveCopy deliberately re-checks NO redundancy
// headroom (it owns only the per-volunteer distinctness/cooldown/feasibility landing

//
// unitID is the work-unit id column expression in scope ("wu.id", "wu2.id", "v.id", ...).
