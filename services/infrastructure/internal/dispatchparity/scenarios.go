// Package dispatchparity holds the SINGLE, shared, table-driven definition of the
// work-unit dispatch eligibility scenarios that both dispatch predicate layers are
// checked against. It exists so a change to the eligibility rule in EITHER layer
// surfaces as a visible failure in a shared table rather than a silent behavioral
// drift between the two.
//
// The dispatch eligibility predicate — "may this requester be handed this QUEUED
// work unit right now?" — lives in FOUR hand-synchronized implementations:
//
//   - the in-memory Go hot path, server.(*dispatchCache).eligibleLocked, which
//     re-checks every per-requester rule against a cached candidate; and
//   - three SQL sites in workunit/pgx-repo.go: FindNextAssignable (the
//     authoritative read-side gate), FlushReservations (the batched hand-out
//     landing write), and ReserveCopy (the single-copy landing write).
//
// Nothing asserted that the four agree. A rule added to one could silently diverge
// from the others. This package is the shared spine of the parity tests that close
// that gap:
//
//   - internal/server/dispatch_predicate_parity_test.go projects each Scenario into
//     in-memory cache state and asserts eligibleLocked's verdict (a plain unit test,
//     always run); and
//   - internal/workunit/dispatch_predicate_parity_test.go seeds each Scenario into
//     Postgres and asserts FindNextAssignable's verdict, plus the subset of the rule
//     that FlushReservations / ReserveCopy re-enforce (an integration test).
//
// A Scenario carries ONLY primitive fields (ints, bools, strings, floats). It must
// not import the workunit or leaf packages: the workunit integration test lives in
// package workunit, so a dependency from this package onto workunit would be an
// import cycle. Each test translates the primitives into its own concrete state
// (workunit.AssignmentOptions, leaf.Leaf, DB rows).
//
// The predicate dimensions covered mirror the rule's structure exactly: redundancy
// headroom, self-held-copy exclusion, already-contributed exclusion, subject
// (DID) distinctness, the post-failure cooldown ("benched"), the per-machine
// in-flight cap, homogeneous-redundancy hardware-class matching,
// runtime/capability fit, feasibility-at-deadline, the trusted-corroborator
// reservation (an untrusted requester withheld from a slot the quorum still needs a
// trusted result to fill), account standing (a BENCHED requester refused all
// dispatch, and copies/results held or submitted by a neutralized account not
// counting toward redundancy coverage — forced replication), and leaf visibility
// (a non-PUBLIC leaf served only to a requester that pinned it by id, PB-38) — with
// boundary cases at each cap/limit edge.
package dispatchparity

// Dimension names the single predicate axis a Scenario primarily exercises. It
// drives two things: readable failure output, and which of the landing-write gates
// (FlushReservations / ReserveCopy) are expected to re-enforce the rule — those
// gates deliberately re-check only a subset (see EnforcedBy).

	//     arithmetic below, not refused at hand-out.
	// (2) Forced replication: a live copy held by — or a PENDING result submitted by — a
	//     neutralized (non-OK) account does NOT COUNT toward a unit's redundancy coverage,
	//     so a unit whose raw coverage looks full stays open for a fresh OK requester until
