// Late container-engine detection (TB-59).
//
// The container runtime used to be built exactly once, before registration,
// and every head was told this machine's runtimes exactly once. An engine
// that came up AFTER the daemon — Docker Desktop still launching behind a
// login item, a Podman machine another program or the user starts later, a
// machine start slower than the 60 s wait — was invisible until a restart,
// while `doctor` (a fresh probe) said it was there. The daemon now keeps the
// detector for its whole life: while at least one head is trusted for
// CONTAINER and no container runtime is registered, it probes again every
// containerRedetectInterval and on request (the management API's redetect
// verb, and a machine start or setup that succeeds through it). When an
// engine answers, the runtime is built exactly as at start, registered, and
// every head is re-registered with the new capability on its next contact.
//
// The same machinery covers the other direction (TB-80): an engine that was
// up and stops answering — a Podman machine whose API socket died behind a
// VM that still reports "running", Docker Desktop quit, a rootless socket
// file nothing listens on. The runtime that reports the outage is taken out
// of service (NoteContainerEngineUnreachable), every buffered container unit
// is returned to its head un-run, the heads are re-told the machine's
// runtimes, and the loop below — which never exits while the daemon runs —
// probes again until the engine answers, then registers a fresh runtime and
// resolves the notice. A probe is a ping, never a fetched unit, and a runtime
// is registered only after its engine has answered one.

// containerRedetectInterval is how often a daemon without a container runtime
// probes for an engine again. A minute is short enough that a login-time
// race (Docker Desktop or a Podman machine coming up after the daemon) costs
// a minute of WASM-only work rather than a restart, and long enough that the
// probe — a binary lookup, a `podman --version`, a Docker ping — is noise
// nobody notices.
